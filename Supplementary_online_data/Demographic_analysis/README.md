# Demographic analysis

`UNDER CONSTRUCTION - COME BACK ON NOVEMBER 23RD, 2020`

To identify the characteristics of at-risk workers, we focused on three European countries: the United Kingdom (UK), France and Italy. We built up a picture of workers (including their gender mix, income and education levels) and their working patterns (i.e. full time or part time) using microdata from the European Union [Labour Force Survey](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/microdata/european-union-labour-force-survey).

## National data

Proportion of workers in high- and low-risk occupations nationally across different demographic characteristics.

## Regional profiles

Regional profiles of ÃŽle de France (France), Lazio and Lombardy (Italy), and Scotland and London (UK).
