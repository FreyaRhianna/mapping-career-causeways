# Analyses of occupational automation risk

## Automation risk for ESCO occupations
**`Automation_risk_for_ESCO_occupations.ipynb`**  
Calculates the overall automation risk and the prevalence of bottleneck tasks for 1627 ESCO occupations. For this purpose, we used the estimates of task suitability for machine learning (SML), originally developed by Brynjolfsson, Mitchell and Rock (2018) for the O\*NET occupations

## Task impact on automation risk
**`Impact_tasks_on_automation.ipynb`**  
Calculates the impact of tasks and work activities on the risk of automation. This was used in the Mapping Career Causeways report to finding the types of tasks and work activities that raise or lower automation risk the most.
