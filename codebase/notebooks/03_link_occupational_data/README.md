# Linking ESCO occupations to labour market data

Here, we build richer occupational profiles by linking ESCO occupations to data such as estimates of annual earnings, capacity to work remotely etc. The output tables of these notebooks are stored in `data/processed/linked_data` folder.

## Education and experience requirements
**`Link_occupations_to_Job_Zones.ipynb`**  
Links ESCO occupations to O\*NET's [Job Zones](https://www.onetonline.org/help/online/zones) and the variables that underpin the Job Zone estimates: education, related work experience, and on-the-job training.

## Annual earnings and paid hours
**`Link_UK_SOC_to_ISCO.ipynb`**  
Explores two options for crosswalking labour market data associated with UK SOC codes to the ESCO occupations - based on the official crosswalk or on the coding index - and exports preprocessed crosswalk tables.

**`Link_occupations_to_UK_earnings_hours.ipynb`**  
Links earnings and hours data from ASHE table 14 to ESCO occupations, by using a UK SOC to ISCO (and hence to ESCO) crosswalk inferred from UK SOC 2010 coding index.

## Potential impact from COVID-19
**`Link_occupations_to_Remote_Labor_Index.ipynb`**  
Links Remote Labor Index (developed by [del Rio-Chanona et al. 2020](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/publications/supply-and-demand-shocks-in-the-covid-19-pandemic-an-industry-and-occupation-perspective/)) to ESCO occupations. The Remote Labor Index indicates what proportion of occupation's work activities can be performed remotely.

**`Estimate_COVID_Exposure.ipynb`**  
Derives a simple estimate for occupational-level exposure to the impact from COVID-19 based on the workersâ€™ physical proximity to other people (determined from O*NET) and on the extent to which the work has to be performed on-site (measured by the Remote Labor Index).
